# Hello! Welcome to the Brain Games!

## **_Description:_**

Brain Games is a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain training. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, it is considered that the game is over. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to go through it again.

## **_Min specs:_**

> Node.js v13 and above.

> Windows 10 with WSL or macOS 10.15+ or any current linux distributive.

## **_Installing instructions:_**
